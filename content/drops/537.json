{"id":537,"content":"Tittabawassee River at Edenville Dam, Michigan: “Dam Failure Threatens a Dow Chemical Complex and Superfund Cleanup”—New York Times, Hiroko Tabuchi, May 20, 2020… “Floodwaters from two breached dams in Michigan on Wednesday flowed into a sprawling Dow chemical complex and threatened a vast Superfund toxic-cleanup site downriver, raising concerns of wider environmental fallout from the dam disaster and historic flooding… Over the years the Dow complex has manufactured a range of products including Saran Wrap, Styrofoam, Agent Orange and mustard gas. Over time, Dow released chemicals into the water, leading to dioxin contamination stretching more than 50 miles along the Tittabawassee and Saginaw Rivers and into Lake Huron.”__no.0537, 2020.#GreatLakes #watercontamination #waterpollution #toxicchemicals #Superfundsite #floodwaters #flooding ","year":2020}
